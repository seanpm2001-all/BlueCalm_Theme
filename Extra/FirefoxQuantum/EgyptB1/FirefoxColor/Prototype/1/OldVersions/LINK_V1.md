## Docs (April 17th 2021)

I started experimenting with the calming blue theme idea I had, but went in a different direction for now compared to the advanced features I had planned. You can see the theme in use on my later screenshots today. Yes, it does look tacky, this is just the first prototype. I am nicknaming it "Egypt B1" (B as in Blue, not Beta) because the zigzag pattern reminds me of Egypt for some reason. Currently, I am just experimenting with it psychologically, and seeing what colors work and what don't. I made sure not to include any yellow or red, as it is commonly associated with negativity (yellow as in error messages, such as ‚ö†Ô∏è red as in error messages üõë as well, along with low battery, and other stressors) I have noted that the menu (not shown in screenshots as of yet) is hard on my eyes, but for whatever reason is emitting a calming feeling to me. I don't know if it is my own bias or not. I will need to do further testing on this. Despite its tackiness, it still serves its purpose for me.

Based on review from one other person, an anonymous family member with vision problems, it has been noted that the green search bar is a problem as well. I never noted it to be a problem. Luckily, this is just a prototype, these issues can be worked out.
