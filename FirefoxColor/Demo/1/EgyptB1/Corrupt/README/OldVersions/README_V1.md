# This theme is corrupt

Please access the theme via the link given in the main `README.md` file. This corrupt theme is used as a demo to demonstrate that Firefox color is currently broken.

## Issue

[See my issue here](https://github.com/mozilla/FirefoxColor/issues/971) nobody has made enough of a fuss about it yet.

There has been an issue with Firefox color across Firefox 57 to 89 that not enough people have noted on the GitHub repository, which is that when you export a theme, you are given corrupted files that don't work, and don't contain your theme.

## Context

My issue:

```markdown

# Cannot export theme

This has been a common issue I have noted by looking at reviews from the past 7 months. I went to install this extension today, and I found that every time I exported the file, it said that it couldn't install the extension, as the extension was corrupt. I can confirm it is, as there is a <600 byte blank SVG file, and a normal JSON file. I am surprised that this isn't being reported as much as it should. I looked through issues before reporting, but couldn't find any recent ones mentioning this, so I will say it here. This may be a duplicate, as this apparently has been an issue for 7 months or more.

I tried to include a screenshot, but the error message goes away before my system can get a screenshot (using F10: PRT SC/Print Screen)

## Device specs

Browser version: Firefox Browser 87.0 for Ubuntu Linux 20.04.1
Operating system: Ubuntu Linux 20.04.1
DE: GNOME 3.36.1
