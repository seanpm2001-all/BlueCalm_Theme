# Planned support for web browsers

This is the list of web browsers I plan to support with the BlueCalm theme:

## Gecko

* Firefox (0.5-4.0)

* Firefox (5.0-27.0)

* Firefox (28.0-56.0)

* Firefox (57.0-87.0)

* Waterfox (?)

* TenFourFox (?)

* GNU IceCat (?)

* Tor (?)

## KHTML

* Konquerer (?)

## Presto

* Opera (?)

## Trident

* Internet explorer (4.0-11.0)

* Microsoft Edge (20.0-40.0)

## Chromium

Chromium support is currently less favored for development, due to the anti-competitive, anti-consumer, anti-developer, anti-web-standards, and bad privacy practices in use by the browsers and the engine. Instead, browsers based on ungoogled Chromium will be developed more.

* Google Chrome (currently not supported) **Support is currently banned**

* Google Chromium (currently not supported) **Support is currently banned**

* Brave (partially supported)

* Modern opera (currently not supported)

* Microsoft Edge (41.0+) (currently not supported)

## WebKit

* Safari (2.0-11.0)
